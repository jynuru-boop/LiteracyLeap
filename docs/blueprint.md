# **App Name**: LiteracyLeap

## Core Features:

- Daily AI Challenge: Generate a daily set of literacy challenges, including reading comprehension, vocabulary (idioms/proverbs), and spelling quizzes, tailored to the student's level based on accumulated points. Adjusts difficulty as student progresses, and monitors student point levels. The LLM acts as a tool in helping teachers manage material preparation.
- Reading Comprehension Exercises: Provide two reading comprehension questions per day, adjusting the difficulty of the text based on the student's cumulative score.
- Vocabulary Quizzes: Offer two vocabulary questions daily, focusing on idioms or proverbs to expand the student's lexical knowledge.
- Spelling and Grammar Quizzes: Present two daily quizzes on Korean spelling and grammar rules, including spacing.
- Gamified Rewards System: Implement a point-based reward system where students earn 20 points per correct answer, up to 120 points per day.
- Badge Ranks: Award character-based badges based on cumulative points, indicating progression through different achievement levels (e.g., 'Seedling', 'Sprout', 'Blossom', 'Fruitful').

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light sky blue (#87CEEB). Inspired by the theme of growth and clarity, it will evoke a sense of calmness and intelligence, as shown in the reference image.
- Background color: Very light cyan (#E0FFFF), to ensure readability and match the clean interface of the reference image.
- Accent color: Muted teal (#70DBD1) for a refreshing and slightly more energetic counterpoint to the primary color, calling to mind the visual idea of progress.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif that provides a modern and warm feel, suitable for both headlines and body text. Use Korean fonts suitable for 초등학생.
- Use clear and engaging icons for the different challenge types (reading, vocabulary, spelling), similar to the intuitive icons in the reference image.
- Follow a clean, card-based layout as seen in the reference image, with rounded corners and ample whitespace.
- Employ subtle, positive animations when earning points or badges.
